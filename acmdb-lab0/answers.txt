I spend about 2 hours to deal with lab0's task.
There used to be a subtask 2.1.3 made me confused, but I think it was removed now, since I pull again and find it disappeared in the doc.
I have not do test on eclipse, I think I will not work no it.
The result of test is a little different with what written in doc. For example, doc says that output should be "Tests run:2, Failures:0, Errors:2", but my ant told me "Tests run:5, Failures:4, Errors:1".
